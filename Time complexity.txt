magine a classroom of 100 students in which you gave your pen to one person.
Now, you want that pen. Here are some ways to find the pen and what the O order is.

O(n2): You go and ask the first person of the class, if he has the pen. 
Also, you ask this person about other 99 people in the classroom if they 
have that pen and so on,This is what we call O(n2).

O(n): Going and asking each student individually is O(N).

O(log n): Now I divide the class into two groups, then ask: 
“Is it on the left side, or the right side of the classroom?” Then I take 
that group and divide it into two and ask again, and so on. Repeat the 
process till you are left with one student who has your pen. 
This is what you mean by O(log n).

+Time Complexity of algorithm/code is not equal to the actual time 
required to execute a particular code but the number of times a 
statement executes.
+ Instead of measuring actual time required in executing each statement in
 the code, we consider how many times each statement execute.
